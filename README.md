# my_simple_TCP
 As stated in the project name, I have attempted to utilize Python to replicate some basic mechanisms of TCP. This project is based on the UDP protocol, with a primary focus on reconstructing the ACK mechanism, which is particularly evident during the transmission of large binary files.The project supports the following formats: .txt, .doc, .docx, .pdf, .html, .htm, .xml, .json, .csv, .exe, .bin, .dll, .so, .dat, .img, .mp3, .mp4, .jpg, .jpeg, and .png. These formats are transmitted as both text files and binary files. The author has only tested the formats with .doc, .jpg, and .txt suffixes. We welcome everyone to try it out and raise any questions.
